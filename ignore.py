#This is an incomplete full version that was last edited aside from this comment two parts ago. In this original file 
#the amount of seconds I got in a year was off by a margin of .04 seconds. And since I made this draft, the amount of 
#parts in an epoch has been changed from 5.01721088026 to just five. And lastly, the length of an epoch has been changed 
#from 432303.417863 seconds to 432303.417808 seconds because the original figure was off by .000055 seconds.
